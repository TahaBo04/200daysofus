    Not all of them were easy.<br>
    Not all of them were light.<br>
    But every single one of them, I chose you.

  <!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENT -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">An honest pause</h2>
    <p class="section-sub">Because pretending everything was perfect would be a lie.</p>

    <p class="reflection">
      We went through misunderstandings.<br>
      Moments where words hurt.<br>
      Moments where silence hurt more.
      <br><br>
      There were times I reacted instead of listening.
      Times I spoke without understanding.
      Times I should have been softer.
      <br><br>
      I see that now.
    </p>

  <!-- LETTER -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="letter">
      <h2 class="script">This is me being honest</h2>

      <p>
        I’m sorry for the moments I made you feel unheard.
        Sorry for the weight you carried when I should have helped lift it.
        Sorry for the confusion when I should have brought clarity.
      </p>

      <p>
        I never wanted to be the source of your pain.
        And when I was — even unintentionally — I take responsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        You deserved patience.
        You deserved reassurance.
        You deserved love that felt safe.
      </p>

      <p class="signature">
        — Still learning. Still choosing you.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY I CHOOSE YOU -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Why I still choose you</h2>

    <ul class="reasons">
      <li>Because love isn’t proven on easy days.</li>
      <li>Because staying matters more than winning.</li>
      <li>Because even after the arguments, you’re still home.</li>
      <li>Because 200 days later — it’s still you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="final-vow">
      I don’t promise perfection.<br>
      I promise effort.
      <br><br>
      I promise to listen more.<br>
      To react less.<br>
      To love you the way you deserve —
      not the way I find easiest.
      <br><br>
      200 days in.<br>
      Still choosing you.
